# YANISH JOGOO

## BIO

With 5 years of experience in data science and 3 in consulting, I possess a strong track-record of building compelling narratives that drive impact by blending data science, an understanding of business strategies and strong interpersonal skills. 

Alongside my primary background in data science, including developing ML models and data analysis, I possess expertise of the full data stack with my knowledge of ETL processes, data engineering (dbt) and data visualisations (Tableau/Foundry).
This technical depth, coupled with my consulting background, equips me to communicate effectively with diverse audiences and seamlessly translate complex concepts for non-technical stakeholders.

Outside of work I am a sports enthusiast, animal rights activist and self-proclaimed board-games expert.
